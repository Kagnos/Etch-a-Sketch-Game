# Etch-a-Sketch-Game
This project has taught me and and expanded my skills with:
* Mixing JavaScript with HTML and CSS
* Troubleshooting and bug fixing
* DOM manipulating like cloning and removing nodes
* Using color inputs
* Nesting JavaScript elements inside event listeners
* Writing legible and neat code
* Git commits

I struggled with implementing darken and lighten buttons into my project and I eventually scrapped them. I think I would have had to change the code I used to interact with the grid items and I just couldn't figure it out.
I also had some issues with git, as seen with the questionable merge.

In conclusion, this is one my best projects to date, and definitely my best JavaScript focused project. I learned a lot of things and I use the skills I've gained in my new projects.
