# Etch-a-Sketch-Game
This project has taught me and and expanded my skills with:
* Mixing JavaScript with HTML and CSS
* Troubleshooting and bug fixing
* DOM manipulating like cloning and removing nodes
* Using color inputs
* Nesting JavaScript elements inside event listeners
* Writing legible and neat code
* Git commits

I struggled with implementing darken and lighten buttons into my project and I eventually scrapped them. I think I would have had to change the code I used to interact with the grid items and I just couldn't figure it out.
I also had some issues with git, as seen with the questionable merge.
I always had to use event listeners with the grid container instead of grid items. I'm not sure if this is because grid container is the parent or I needed to use a query selector all, but I believe it affect my ability to implement buttons, especially the darken and lighten buttons.

In conclusion, this is one my best projects to date, and definitely my best JavaScript focused project. I learned a lot of things and I use the skills I've gained in my new projects.
